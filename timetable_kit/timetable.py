    train_numbers_side_by_side: For column headers for a column with multiple trains, put train numbers side by side.
        Default is to stack them top to bottom.
    is_ardp_station: pass a function which says whether a station should have arrival times;
        "False" means false for all; "True" means true for all
        Default is "dwell" (case sensitive), which uses dwell_secs_cutoff.
    dwell_secs_cutoff: Show arrival & departure times if dwell time is this many seconds
        or higher for some train in the tt_spec
        Defaults to 300, meaning 5 minutes.
        Probably don't want to ever make it less than 1 minute.
    use_bus_icon_in_cells: Put a bus icon next to timetable cells which are a bus.
