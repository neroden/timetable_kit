Routines for extracting Amtrak's JSON station data and working with it.

Amtrak's entire station database is exposed as JSON, which is very useful.
In order to download it, this must be run as a program.

A couple of key pieces of data are only exposed as HTML, so the HTML is downloaded too.

The other routines here are for accessing it.

get_station_name is the primary one.
