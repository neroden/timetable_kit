For making updates easier:
-- Adapt check_ghost_trains.py to compare a list to weekday / saturday / sunday / weekend output
from the ./list_trains.py program (this is currently largely manual)

-- Auto-destination cell code to generate the words "to Charlotte" (etc) by looking at the train route?

-- Fail if duplicate TSNs are called, rather than warning (avoids trouble, forces disambiguation)

For VIA and generic timetables:
1 -- start reading calendar_dates.txt

For prettiness:
1 -- get the "sleeper" symbol printing (the icon and hooks are ready)

For generalizing beyond Amtrak and VIA:
0 -- Fix up templates for multi-agency timetables, by redesigning the interface to allow for a list
1 -- Write "generic agency" code (largely based on VIA), then have Amtrak & VIA inherit from it
2 -- Write a routine to patch Amtrak's GTFS based on the wheelchair access detection
      from the Amtrak stations database.

For simplifying and making Amtrak & VIA work better:
1 -- Add checked_baggage field to GTFS specification (stops.txt and trips.txt).
     This is way too SOCIAL for me to want to actually do it!
     But it would massively simplify a large hunk of code

Internal cleanup:
-1 -- Stop the duplicate loading of the feed in VIA's wheelchair access check.
      We need to drive the feed loading down into a place where it's available to
      the wheelchair access check directly.  This might be done with the aforementioned
      "generic agency" code which I haven't written.

    Plan for this: pass the agency through to produce_timetable instead of the feed.
    Initialize the feed in the initialization of the agency (possibly with commandline override).
    The feed is then available and present within the agency object.

0 -- memoize connecting services initialization (& wrapperize the dict)
     so that it doesn't run from auxiliary progs like list_trains.py.

1 -- consider adding "Route name" notation based on location of Station column (see Hartford Line)

2 -- Routine to print out calendar for a single route,
     with out-of-period dates removed, for inspection

3 -- Test install and resolve other problematic directory references

4 -- Resolve command-line functions in amtrak/ & via/ into a __main__.py

5 -- Improve calendar filtering for days of week
    Still not clear what the best approach for this is.

    Failing to filter for the days of the week can give two calendars
    or zero, where I'm looking for one.

    Amtrak, upsettingly, has a lot of weird one-day service calendars.
    These are best described as "confusing".  This messed up the CONO
    timetable generator for 20220312.

    To make matters worse, there are calendar gaps in other timetables,
    like the Cardinal one.  We need a better presentation on this crap.

6 -- Sanitize pathnames coming from command line and environment.
    We're very sloppy right now.

7 -- add a way to specify "special CSS" in the JSON, in order to avoid duplicative work in the CSV.
      Basically allow a CSS class, or several, to be embedded in the JSON and referenced in the CSV.

8 -- lean on pre-existing code in GTFS_kit where possible (restrict_*)


Fine for never:
9 -- implement prototype spec generator using toposort to merge station lists.
     This is really a many-step process.

Wishlist:
10 -- "Reverse style" timetables with stations on top and trains on the left.  This would just be cool.
(OK.  It would be AWESOME.)

CSS Paged Media project:
- Unique table IDs.
Allows header styling to work on multiple timetables in same HTML document.
- Move font selection out of CSS jinja substitutions (somehow).
This allows two unrelated HTML timetable pages to share the same CSS,
which is needed to generate multipage HTML directly.

Long term (?):
- Patch PANDAS to allow insertion of classes in header rows.
- This seems straightforward.
- tests/io/format is where the test is.
- need a parallel to cell_context (header_context).
- Have to set up another project contributor profile etc so OMG.  Not this month.

Timetable update stuff:
-----------------------
Known Amtrak GTFS bugs:
- Bug in Arizona times (listing as Denver rather than Phoenix), reported & patched
- Maple Leaf Canadian data wrong in Amtrak (VIA is correct)
- Maple Leaf American data wrong in VIA (Amtrak is probably correct)
- One "missing train" in NEC (assume this is real and has been discontinued)

VIA Rail stuff:
- Check for which stations are "manned" for checked baggage info

Amtrak schedules to put off, because these have printable state agency timetables, or almost:
- Downeaster
---- The official timetable is better than anything I can produce.
- San Joaquins
- Capitol Corridor
- Pacific Surfliner
- Cascades - Oregon Point bus schedule problem
