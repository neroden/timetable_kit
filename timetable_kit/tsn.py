"""
Routines to convert between trip_id and trip_short_name.

In GTFS, trip_id is unique.  So a trip_id to trip_short_name map should be, too.
However, trip_short_name isn't unique.  But it is usually unique on a given calendar day,
so it should be possible to make a map from a restricted feed.

Unfortunately, the same trip_short_name can have different schedules on different days of
the week.  So we may need to map for days of the week as well.

Also contains other routines which look up trips by tsn.
