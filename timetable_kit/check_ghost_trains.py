"""
This program essentially compares two lists:

a) The list of trains in a .csv spec file that we think are running
b) The list of trains from an external .txt file that are actually running

It will print differences so manual tweaks to the .csv can be done.

The external .txt files for trains actually running are on 
https://juckins.net/timetable_kit/trains_running/

Example filename: trains-actually-running-empire-service.txt

The following is the list of route names as given in Amtrak's Track-A-Train data
(converted to lowercase, any spaces or slashes replaced with a "-") that are
used in the .txt files:

acela
adirondack
amtrak-cascades
auto-train
california-zephyr
capitol-corridor
capitol-limited
cardinal
carolinian-piedmont
city-of-new-orleans
coast-starlight
crescent
downeaster
empire-builder
empire-service
ethan-allen-express
heartland-flyer
hiawatha
illinois-service
keystone
lake-shore-limited
lincoln-service-missouri-river-runner
maple-leaf
michigan-services
missouri-river-runner
northeast-regional
pacific-surfliner
pennsylvanian
san-joaquins
silver-service-palmetto
southwest-chief
sunset-limited
texas-eagle
vermonter
winter-park-express

Adirondack is missing but will likely come back in the future.
