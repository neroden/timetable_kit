Good morning,

Thank you for contacting Via Rail Canada.

No trains in the Corridor have checked baggage service at this time.

Only Long Haul trains (Toronto to Vancouver, Halifax to Montreal, 
Winnipeg to Churchill, Montreal to Jonquiere/Senneterre, Jasper to 
Prince Rupert and Sudbury to White River) have checked baggage service 
and only at manned stations on these routes.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,
